# MCP Agentic AI for Cloud

This repository demonstrates a simple Agentic AI running on an MCP-style server
to analyze cloud cost data and suggest safe, governed optimization actions.

The project focuses on clarity, governance, and real-world FinOps use cases
rather than complex automation.

## What this repository contains
- A minimal agent workflow for cloud cost analysis
- Sample cost ingestion and normalization
- Reference runbook for setup and operation
- Synthetic data for safe testing and demos

## Important note
This is a reference implementation.
No production credentials or real customer data should be used.
